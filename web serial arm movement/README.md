# Web Serial API
The Web Serial API provides websites with the ability to read from and write to serial devices. These devices can be connected via a serial port or be USB or Bluetooth devices that emulate a serial port.

# Goal
develop this page: [Click here](https://github.com/Deemowe/task1/tree/main/speech%20recognition)\
to allow the device receive the instructions from the speaker using javascript 

# Important Notes
* You should apply the code using Google Chrome. 
* Make sure that the browser language is set to Arabic.
* Required to install [Arduino IDE](https://github.com/Deemowe/task1/tree/main/Wasdom%20ESP32%20link%20steps)
* After the text appears, you need to press **Space** to submit the text!
* The serial device is not available so the text in **استجابة الذراع** will not appear :(
